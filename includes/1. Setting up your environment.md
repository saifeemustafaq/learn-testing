# Setting up your environment

## Quick Steps
- Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Install the C++ extension in VSCode
- Install a compiler - [MINGW](https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/downloads/68260/mingw-get-setup.exe/)




## Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
1. Go here to download the [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) setup.
2. Install the VSCode that you just downloaded.

## Install the C++ extension in VSCode
1. Click on the Extension Icon.
   ![Extension](https://github.com/saifeemustafaq/learn-testing/raw/main/Assets/1_extension_icon.jpg)

2. Search for `C++`
   ![Option for C++](https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/languages/cpp/search-cpp-extension.png)

3. Click on ***Install*** and install this extension.
4. Restart VSCode

## Install a compiler
VS Code is first and foremost an editor so we need to download and install a compiler. We will go to the MINGW Download link and download it then install the GCC compiler using command prompt.

1. Click here to download the MINGW. Install the file that you just downloaded. When the installation starts, it will look something like this:
   
   ![MINGW](https://github.com/saifeemustafaq/learn-testing/raw/main/Assets/3_mingw_installation.png)

2. Click on `Quit` after the installation is done.
> Note: Adding MINGW to the `Environment path variables` is very important. Doing this lets the system know the path of `mingw-get.exe` whenever it's called from the command prompt.


3. Press ***WindowsKey + R***. This will open-up ***Run***. Type the following in the ***Run*** and press ***Enter***:  
   `rundll32.exe sysdm.cpl,EditEnvironmentVariables`

   You will see this window open up:

   ![Environment_Variables](https://github.com/saifeemustafaq/learn-testing/raw/main/Assets/4_env.png)

   Double click on ***Path*** which is in the lower ***System variables*** section.

4. After you have double clicked on the ***Path***, a new window has opened up ***Edit environment variable***. In this window click on ***New*** and then enter this:  
   `C:\MinGW\bin`

   It will look like this:

   ![Path_set](https://github.com/saifeemustafaq/learn-testing/raw/main/Assets/5_mingwpath.png)

   Click on ***OK*** on all the remaining windows.

> We have installed MinGW and added it to path variable successfully.

5. Now using MinGW we will be installing the GCC Compiler.
