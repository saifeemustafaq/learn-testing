# Writing your first C++ program and Run it

As we will be doing a lot of exercise, lets create a folder and define that folder in the VSCode Editor for easy management of files.

1. Create a folder anywhere you desire.  
   (In this tutorial we will be creating a folder named ***cpp*** on the desktop.)
2. No open VSCode and click on ***File***
3. Click on ***Open Folder*** and in the poped up window Navigate to the folder ***cpp*** which is located on the desktop and click ***Select Folder***
4. Now you can see your directory and the editor side by side.

# Hello World!

## Let's write a ***Hello World!*** program

1. Create a new file by clicking on ***File*** and then ***New File***
2. To get the benefit of the C++ extension we have to specify that this is a `.cpp` file so after you have created the new file press ***WindowsKey + S*** and save the file as ***hello.cpp***
3. Type the following code in the newly created file:  
   ```
   #include<iostream>

    using namespace std;

    void main()
    {
    	cout<<"Hello World";
    }
    ```

    Now click on ***Run*** in the Menu bar and click on ***Start Debugging***. It will ask you which compiler you want to use, click on ***C++ (GDB/LLDB)***
