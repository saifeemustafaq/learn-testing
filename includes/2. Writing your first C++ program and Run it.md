# Writing your first C++ program and Run it

As we will be doing a lot of exercise, lets create a folder and define that folder in the VSCode Editor for easy management of files.

1. Create a folder anywhere you desire.  
   (In this tutorial we will be creating a folder named ***cpp*** on the desktop.)
2. No open VSCode and click on ***File***
3. Click on ***Open Folder*** and in the poped up window Navigate to the folder ***cpp*** which is located on the desktop and click ***Select Folder***
4. Now you can see your directory and the editor side by side.

# Hello World!

## Let's write a ***Hello World!*** program

1. Create a new file by clicking on ***File*** and then ***New File***
2. To get the benefit of the C++ extension we have to specify that this is a `.cpp` file so after you have created the new file press ***WindowsKey + S*** and save the file as ***hello.cpp***
3. Type the following code in the newly created file:  
   ```
   #include <iostream>

   using namespace std;

   int main()
   {
      cout << "Hello World" << endl;

      return 0;
   }
   ```

4. Now let's ***BUILD*** this piece of code. Press ***Ctrl + Shift + B*** and a few option will come-up looking like this:

   ![Build_Options](https://github.com/saifeemustafaq/learn-testing/raw/main/Assets/9_gcc_options.png)

   Select the `C/C++:g++.exe build active file`  
     
   This will build the ***hello.exe*** file for you in the same directory.

5. Now press **`` Ctrl + Shift + ` ``**
   
   > If you are wondering what that symbol is, it's called a *backtick* and you can find it just before the *number 1 button* on your keyboard.

   > What this combination **`` Ctrl + Shift + ` ``** does is, it opens a new Terminal in the *current working directory* where your code file is located.

6. Now we have a hello.exe file in our directory, let's run that file. In the terminal that you just opened by pressing **`` Ctrl + Shift + ` ``**, type 
   ```
   .\hello.exe
   ```  
     
   This will look similar to this:
